<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XJXdczd.png">

This tool checks Zula game accounts via HTTP requests and retrieves detailed account info such as rank, nickname, level, KD, registration date, and total ZA transaction history.
It uses [CapSolver](https://capsolver.com/) to bypass Turnstile (Cloudflare) challenges.

### üìå Notes

Proxy support is included but commented out. To enable it:
```
proxy = random.choice(open("proxy.txt").readlines()).strip()
session.proxies = {'http': 'http://' + proxy, 'https': 'http://' + proxy}
```
Captcha-solving and verification logic is fully request-based (no Selenium, Puppeteer, etc.)
